/**
 * An object for traversing and partitioning elements of a source.  The source
 * of elements covered by a Spliterator could be, for example, an array, a
 * {@link Collection}, an IO channel, or a generator function.
 *
 * <p>A Spliterator may traverse elements individually ({@link
 * #tryAdvance tryAdvance()}) or sequentially in bulk
 * ({@link #forEachRemaining forEachRemaining()}).
 *
 * <p>A Spliterator may also partition off some of its elements (using
 * {@link #trySplit}) as another Spliterator, to be used in
 * possibly-parallel operations.  Operations using a Spliterator that
 * cannot split, or does so in a highly imbalanced or inefficient
 * manner, are unlikely to benefit from parallelism.  Traversal
 * and splitting exhaust elements; each Spliterator is useful for only a single
 * bulk computation.
 *
 * <p>A Spliterator also reports a set of {@link #characteristics()} of its
 * structure, source, and elements from among {@link #ORDERED},
 * {@link #DISTINCT}, {@link #SORTED}, {@link #SIZED}, {@link #NONNULL},
 * {@link #IMMUTABLE}, {@link #CONCURRENT}, and {@link #SUBSIZED}. These may
 * be employed by Spliterator clients to control, specialize or simplify
 * computation.  For example, a Spliterator for a {@link Collection} would
 * report {@code SIZED}, a Spliterator for a {@link Set} would report
 * {@code DISTINCT}, and a Spliterator for a {@link SortedSet} would also
 * report {@code SORTED}.  Characteristics are reported as a simple unioned bit
 * set.
 *
 * Some characteristics additionally constrain method behavior; for example if
 * {@code ORDERED}, traversal methods must conform to their documented ordering.
 * New characteristics may be defined in the future, so implementors should not
 * assign meanings to unlisted values.
 *
 * <p><a id="binding">A Spliterator that does not report {@code IMMUTABLE} or
 * {@code CONCURRENT} is expected to have a documented policy concerning:
 * when the spliterator <em>binds</em> to the element source; and detection of
 * structural interference of the element source detected after binding.</a>  A
 * <em>late-binding</em> Spliterator binds to the source of elements at the
 * point of first traversal, first split, or first query for estimated size,
 * rather than at the time the Spliterator is created.  A Spliterator that is
 * not <em>late-binding</em> binds to the source of elements at the point of
 * construction or first invocation of any method.  Modifications made to the
 * source prior to binding are reflected when the Spliterator is traversed.
 * After binding a Spliterator should, on a best-effort basis, throw
 * {@link ConcurrentModificationException} if structural interference is
 * detected.  Spliterators that do this are called <em>fail-fast</em>.  The
 * bulk traversal method ({@link #forEachRemaining forEachRemaining()}) of a
 * Spliterator may optimize traversal and check for structural interference
 * after all elements have been traversed, rather than checking per-element and
 * failing immediately.
 *
 * <p>Spliterators can provide an estimate of the number of remaining elements
 * via the {@link #estimateSize} method.  Ideally, as reflected in characteristic
 * {@link #SIZED}, this value corresponds exactly to the number of elements
 * that would be encountered in a successful traversal.  However, even when not
 * exactly known, an estimated value may still be useful to operations
 * being performed on the source, such as helping to determine whether it is
 * preferable to split further or traverse the remaining elements sequentially.
 *
 * <p>Despite their obvious utility in parallel algorithms, spliterators are not
 * expected to be thread-safe; instead, implementations of parallel algorithms
 * using spliterators should ensure that the spliterator is only used by one
 * thread at a time.  This is generally easy to attain via <em>serial
 * thread-confinement</em>, which often is a natural consequence of typical
 * parallel algorithms that work by recursive decomposition.  A thread calling
 * {@link #trySplit()} may hand over the returned Spliterator to another thread,
 * which in turn may traverse or further split that Spliterator.  The behaviour
 * of splitting and traversal is undefined if two or more threads operate
 * concurrently on the same spliterator.  If the original thread hands a
 * spliterator off to another thread for processing, it is best if that handoff
 * occurs before any elements are consumed with {@link #tryAdvance(Consumer)
 * tryAdvance()}, as certain guarantees (such as the accuracy of
 * {@link #estimateSize()} for {@code SIZED} spliterators) are only valid before
 * traversal has begun.
 *
 * <p>Primitive subtype specializations of {@code Spliterator} are provided for
 * {@link OfInt int}, {@link OfLong long}, and {@link OfDouble double} values.
 * The subtype default implementations of
 * {@link Spliterator#tryAdvance(java.util.function.Consumer)}
 * and {@link Spliterator#forEachRemaining(java.util.function.Consumer)} box
 * primitive values to instances of their corresponding wrapper class.  Such
 * boxing may undermine any performance advantages gained by using the primitive
 * specializations.  To avoid boxing, the corresponding primitive-based methods
 * should be used.  For example,
 * {@link Spliterator.OfInt#tryAdvance(java.util.function.IntConsumer)}
 * and {@link Spliterator.OfInt#forEachRemaining(java.util.function.IntConsumer)}
 * should be used in preference to
 * {@link Spliterator.OfInt#tryAdvance(java.util.function.Consumer)} and
 * {@link Spliterator.OfInt#forEachRemaining(java.util.function.Consumer)}.
 * Traversal of primitive values using boxing-based methods
 * {@link #tryAdvance tryAdvance()} and
 * {@link #forEachRemaining(java.util.function.Consumer) forEachRemaining()}
 * does not affect the order in which the values, transformed to boxed values,
 * are encountered.
 *
 * @apiNote
 * <p>Spliterators, like {@code Iterator}s, are for traversing the elements of
 * a source.  The {@code Spliterator} API was designed to support efficient
 * parallel traversal in addition to sequential traversal, by supporting
 * decomposition as well as single-element iteration.  In addition, the
 * protocol for accessing elements via a Spliterator is designed to impose
 * smaller per-element overhead than {@code Iterator}, and to avoid the inherent
 * race involved in having separate methods for {@code hasNext()} and
 * {@code next()}.
 *
 * <p>For mutable sources, arbitrary and non-deterministic behavior may occur if
 * the source is structurally interfered with (elements added, replaced, or
 * removed) between the time that the Spliterator binds to its data source and
 * the end of traversal.  For example, such interference will produce arbitrary,
 * non-deterministic results when using the {@code java.util.stream} framework.
 *
 * <p>Structural interference of a source can be managed in the following ways
 * (in approximate order of decreasing desirability):
 * <ul>
 * <li>The source cannot be structurally interfered with.
 * <br>For example, an instance of
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArrayList} is an immutable source.
 * A Spliterator created from the source reports a characteristic of
 * {@code IMMUTABLE}.</li>
 * <li>The source manages concurrent modifications.
 * <br>For example, a key set of a {@link java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap}
 * is a concurrent source.  A Spliterator created from the source reports a
 * characteristic of {@code CONCURRENT}.</li>
 * <li>The mutable source provides a late-binding and fail-fast Spliterator.
 * <br>Late binding narrows the window during which interference can affect
 * the calculation; fail-fast detects, on a best-effort basis, that structural
 * interference has occurred after traversal has commenced and throws
 * {@link ConcurrentModificationException}.  For example, {@link ArrayList},
 * and many other non-concurrent {@code Collection} classes in the JDK, provide
 * a late-binding, fail-fast spliterator.</li>
 * <li>The mutable source provides a non-late-binding but fail-fast Spliterator.
 * <br>The source increases the likelihood of throwing
 * {@code ConcurrentModificationException} since the window of potential
 * interference is larger.</li>
 * <li>The mutable source provides a late-binding and non-fail-fast Spliterator.
 * <br>The source risks arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior after traversal
 * has commenced since interference is not detected.
 * </li>
 * <li>The mutable source provides a non-late-binding and non-fail-fast
 * Spliterator.
 * <br>The source increases the risk of arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior
 * since non-detected interference may occur after construction.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Example.</b> Here is a class (not a very useful one, except
 * for illustration) that maintains an array in which the actual data
 * are held in even locations, and unrelated tag data are held in odd
 * locations. Its Spliterator ignores the tags.
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * class TaggedArray<T> {

 *
 * <p>As an example how a parallel computation framework, such as the
 * {@code java.util.stream} package, would use Spliterator in a parallel
 * computation, here is one way to implement an associated parallel forEach,
 * that illustrates the primary usage idiom of splitting off subtasks until
 * the estimated amount of work is small enough to perform
 * sequentially. Here we assume that the order of processing across
 * subtasks doesn't matter; different (forked) tasks may further split
 * and process elements concurrently in undetermined order.  This
 * example uses a {@link java.util.concurrent.CountedCompleter};
 * similar usages apply to other parallel task constructions.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * static <T> void parEach(TaggedArray<T> a, Consumer<T> action) {
 *   Spliterator<T> s = a.spliterator();
 *   long targetBatchSize = s.estimateSize() / (ForkJoinPool.getCommonPoolParallelism() * 8);
 *   new ParEach(null, s, action, targetBatchSize).invoke();
 * }
 *
 * static class ParEach<T> extends CountedCompleter<Void> {
 *   final Spliterator<T> spliterator;
 *   final Consumer<T> action;
 *   final long targetBatchSize;
 *
 *   ParEach(ParEach<T> parent, Spliterator<T> spliterator,
 *           Consumer<T> action, long targetBatchSize) {
 *     super(parent);
 *     this.spliterator = spliterator; this.action = action;
 *     this.targetBatchSize = targetBatchSize;
 *   }
 *
 *   public void compute() {
 *     Spliterator<T> sub;
 *     while (spliterator.estimateSize() > targetBatchSize &&
 *            (sub = spliterator.trySplit()) != null) {
